# Webpack TS Starter

Basic boilerplate to start new HTML5 Canvas projects with Typescript.

## Features

Work in progress...

But hopefully some of the main features will be:

- Vector class to create movement using vector math
- Some helpful general utils (probably just taken off the p5.js source code or things I see myself doing again and again)
- Typescript
- Webpack with HMR
- Eslint, prettier, husky, and all that jazz
